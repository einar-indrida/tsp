try_tsp_1.py - a short TSP solver in Python. Works by finding all permutations, and
checking them.  Works, in a way, for small problems, but explodes as the problems 
get bigger.

try_tsp_2.c - Implementation in C, compare it to the Python version

try_tsp_3a.c - Another implementation in C, this time, storing the distance, instead of
calculating it per iteration.
